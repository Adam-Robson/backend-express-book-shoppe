## General Information

This project was originally built while at Alchemy Code Lab in Portland,
  Oregon. Since it's original iteration, I converted the project to
  TypeScript, and have added various features as time moves on.

## Features

This backend application uses Express to create a server and Postgres to
  create a database. It includes the functionality to Create Read Update
  and Delete books from the database. It also includes authentication and
  authorization, tracking users and roles accordingly.

## Run Locally

| `npm start`            | Starts the app - should only be used in          |
|                        |   production as changes will not get reloaded    |
| `npm run start:watch`  | Runs the app using `nodemon` which watches for   |
                         |   changes and reloads the app                    |
| `npm test`             | Runs the tests once                              |

                         |   files are updated                              |
| `npm run setup-db`     | Sets up the database locally                     |
| `npm run setup-heroku` | Sets up the database on Heroku                   |
